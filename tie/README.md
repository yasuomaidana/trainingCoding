Technical Interview Exercises (TIE) is a lightweight open-source tool aimed at
helping students learn key concepts, principles, and coding patterns that are
important in software engineering. TIE allows users to write code to solve
technical coding challenges and receive real time insightful and guiding
feedback.

The project is currently in early Beta. This means that content and features are
limited. We plan to add more content and features as we develop towards version
1.

## User setup

1. From https://github.com/google/tie/, click on the green "Clone or download"
button then click "Download ZIP"
2. Unzip the zip file
3. Open the file client/question/question.html in a web browser
4. Use the coding window on the right to code a solution and click "I think I'm
done" if you think you have answer (repeat until you solve the question)
