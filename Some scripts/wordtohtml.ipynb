Therefore, we only get the final result after all the recursive calls have returned some value.

By doing this, we pass the results of the current step to the next recursive call to the function.

This is called a stack overflow, and it means that we run out of memory to hold the frames in the call stack. To avoid the stack overflow, Python sets a limit for the total number of frames that the call stack can hold. The default limit is 999 (the maximum number of frames that the call stack can hold).
